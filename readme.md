# Statues
## Intro

This is a projec that I wanted to build about 3-4 years ago but never got around to it. The project is 
focused on confederate statues and when they went up around the U.S. As a history major and a big 
Civil war guy, I'm really interested in doing this project. I'm not sure why I kept putting it off but 
a few months ago I finally got a good dataset. I downloaded it and put it on my desktop telling myself 
that I'll soon get to the project and start working on it. Well, I'm going to start doing that. 

This will be a larger project - using MYSQL, Python - flask and Vue.js. It will have a log in system 
and then allow the user to play with the data that I have so that one can see information regarding these 
statues.
